{"name":"Mysql-autoconfig","tagline":"Perl Script to configure mysql based on the server it is run on","body":"# mysql-autoconfig\r\nThis is a handy Perl Script I wrote which will configure mysql based on the server it is run on.\r\n\r\nI wrote this script a while back so that users of my software ([LogZilla](http://www.logzilla.net)) would have help with configuring their servers.\r\n\r\nOver the years, I found that most of the users had no idea why their server was \"slow\" and it was because they just used the default mysql config, which is quite horrible of course.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is the best method, but I have never found anything on the net that does it based on the server it is run on. (Why doesn't mysql do this automatically?)\r\n\r\nI am uploading it here in the hopes that someone who knows MySQL better than me can perhaps add/remove or make it better so that the community can get better performance out of their MySQL servers.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
